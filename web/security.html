	Only 8% of worldâ€™s currency is physical money, this means the rest of 92% only exists on computer hard drives, in electronic bank accounts around the world. This means security plays a big role to keep all the data safe and encrypted so we can live our lives without the fear of losing money or any private data. Not only banks, but even in our daily lives security plays a massive role. Cyber Security is the reason our data is safe in the cloud. The personal emails, Dropbox files, Google Drive files and many more platforms are secure due to this.
