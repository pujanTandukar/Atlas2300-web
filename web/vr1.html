 	Virtual reality enables you to learn just about anything. You can immerse yourself in the culture of another country, learn their language and interact with the local people without ever leaving your home. It can help us further understand highly-complex fields such as rocket science, astrophysics and artificial intelligence through virtual hands-on experience. This will help to progress our understanding faster as it is a 3 dimentional teaching practice rather than the standard two dimention.
