<h3>Hypertext Narrative Brief</h3>

		    Ever since I was a little kid, I had access to technology. I grew up in Nepal and it’s a country that is slowly developing. Back in the mid 2000’s, computers were super rare in Nepal. Only certain people were lucky enough to have access to one. And I was one of them. For this hypertext narrative, I want to take my viewers to an adventure through time. I want to talk about how technology in general has changed in the last 10-15 years and add a little bit of personal twist into it. I want to talk and make users aware of how technology ties us in this modern world and how even till this day, a vast majority of people in this world don’t even know it exists. I want to showcase different areas of technology but I want to focus on what we use to connect with each other. For example, talking more about the internet, computers, phones, etc rather than different technologies such as microwaves or refrigerators. For this project, I want to create a simple tree like website, which enables the user to take different paths and learn a little more about how technology has come so far. Users will be able to take different approach to the website but I want everyone who visits this website to have a general idea of what I am talking about. I also want to make a option for viewers to explore how other countries and other places have developed in the last couple of years compared to the United States. I want to talk about how technology affects someone and the benefits and advantages to it. I also want to tie this to my childhood in a way, where i can tell a separate story from my point of view. The users will have a choice to either explore that realm or not. The website will be structured like this: it will have a starting point, ie one home page which will detach into multiple different sub pages, but it will all come back to the same end page, which will summarize what the whole journey was about. This will be like an adventure book, user who want to go on an adventure will have the absolute freedom but if someone wants to just know something general about the change in technology, they will have the option to do so.
