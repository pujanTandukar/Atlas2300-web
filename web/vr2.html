 	Remote control capabilities meaning, being able to control and see through the lenses of a remote controlled device. Imagine flying a drone through a VR headset. The DJI Mavic, already has built in VR control meaning you can attach a headset and "be the drone". Other applications could be using Virtual Reality to control a spaceship and exploring depth of space.
