	A quantum computer is essentially a way to harness quantum mechanics to process information. A computer uses bits to record one of two states, 0 or 1, true or false, or open or closed. But qubit, a quantum bit, takes advantage of quantum mechanics in such a way that it can have a superposition of states, meaning it can be a mixture of 0 or 1 at the same time. So, this can be used to crunch complex calculations in a short amount of time. For example, calculating factors of very large numbers and this plays a huge role in encryption. This could be good or bad. Good in a sense that, after quantum computers arrive, encryption will be very secure and hard to hack. Bad in a sense that, a user with quantum computing power can easily decrypt the encryption that we have right now.
