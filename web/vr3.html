 	Virtual Reality gives you an alternate reality where you can virtually do anything. For example, if you were looking to tour a college campus such as MIT, you will be able to do that. You can be a part of the concert, virtually. You can also experience a life style of a bird by using a bird simulator which captures the perspective through a bird's eye.
