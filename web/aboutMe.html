		     Hello everyone! My name is Pujan Tandukar. I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal and spent majority of my childhood there. I am persuing my BS degree in Computer Science and minoring in TAM. I am always trying to learn something new. Recently I picked up on learning the guitar and singing. I also play the piano, the "River Flows in You" is my favorite piece of play, it's by Yiruma. Soccer and Football are my type of sport!
